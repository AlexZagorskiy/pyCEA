In order to use this, please download the original Fortran code from the NASA 
webpage: http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/CEAWeb/ceaguiDownload-unix.htm. Untar the 
content of the file into a folder here and that's it! 

It is assumed the resulting folder name containing all the files is CEA+FORTRAN.

Follow the run.py code to check the usage. Can't be easier than that.
